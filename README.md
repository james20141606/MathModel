This is a repository of my math model course
I have done three projects through this course. 
###First we construct a model to solve problems about picking a conference host city concerning time lag
An AHP methods and some other distance calculating methods has been applied.
###Second we construct machine learning model to predict video experience using some variables collected by Huawei.
I use SVR and MLP and other models to predict.
###Third we do some prediction work about NBA
The work includes NBADraft. I use factor analysis and other methods to evaluate their performance to instruct NBA draft.<br>
I also predict NBA teams ranking, I are inspired by ELO scoring systems in chess, and did some experiment to predict the ranks. <br>
I also try some big data analysis. I try to get some data recorded by a very high-technique equipment:SportsVU. It recorded every players in court 25 times per second. I have tried to use python to produce an animition using the big data in one play(Cavs Vs GSW). It is very fascinating. Also I want to analyze it and use deep learning to predict the play, but it seems so challenging to me that there is no time to do it.

This course is the first time for me to learn to construct math model, also it is the first time for me to learn to write code. So in 2017 spring, I learned a lot through this course, I learn python and MATLAB, from a rookie to a practical learner. I also get to learn some machine learning knowledge. The final project got excellent score in the course.
